* Introduction

  Dataframes are a central object within the S language.  They are
  extensions of matrices, which are a specialization of arrays, and so
  could be considered a specialization of arrays.  Dataframes,
  however, provide a link between statistical data and the
  corresponding numerical data which, for the resulting statistical
  procedures, is manipulated through numerical linear algebra.

  We have a virtual dataframe class, which inherits from the
  MATRIX-LIKE class in LISP-MATRIX.  LISP-MATRIX constructs a
  framework for numerical linear algebra using a range of "storage
  back-ends", currently lisp-arrays (using Tamas Papp's
  Foriegn-Friendly-Array (FFA) package) and foriegn arrays (using Rif
  Rifkin's foreign-numerical-value (FNV) package).

  Future plans currently include implementing a listoflist backend for
  both matrices and dataframes, as well as GSLL backend for matrices
  (not clear if usable for dataframes).

* Dataframe implementation

  The DATAFRAME-LIKE class directly generalizes the MATRIX-LIKE class
  by adding statistically-relevant typing to columns, along with case
  ids (row names) and column ids (variable names).  We need to
  construct a common nomenclature for this.
