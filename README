For a fast start: 

run a common lisp (SBCL, CMUCL, CLISP) starting in the current
directory.   We also assume that a recent version of CFFI has been
installed and is ASDF-loadable.  Probably should include a local copy
just in case.

Step through ls-demo.lisp for a range of examples that will become
part of the test suite.
