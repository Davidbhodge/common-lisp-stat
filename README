===========

Current design challenge :: we need to find a means to avoid circular
references, especially where call-backs are concerned.

Perhaps we should put the glue where it belongs, and if we use a
package or tool which replaces it, then we no longer have to provide
such FFI glue.

This would suggest that we proceed as follows -- first make sure that
we factor out the library loading into a separate package which is
required, and then we embed the callback support into the individual
libraries to make them work.
