===========

See Doc/README* for history and design considerations
See Doc/INSTALL for getting this to work and run

===========

For a fast start: 

run a common lisp (SBCL, CMUCL, CLISP) starting in the current
directory.   We also assume that a recent version of CFFI has been
installed and is ASDF-loadable.  Probably should include a local copy
just in case.

Step through ls-demo.lisp for a range of examples that will become
part of the test suite.


So basically ..   

1. change directory into the CommonLispStat working directory.
2. start your lisp
3. follow the commands in the ls-demo.lisp file, i.e.

   a. (load "init.lisp")
   b. (in-package :ls-user)
   c. (normal-rand 20)
   d. (setf mytest (normal-rand 20))

   and see if they work (basic CFFI functionality for external C
   library, LIFT package for unit-testing framework to ensure run time
   stability).

4. Tell me ( <blindglobe@gmail.com> ) if there is any thing wrong (or
   if anything happens to work.


What to expect:

CMUCL and SBCL work justfine at this stage.

CLISP is finicky regarding the problems that we have with CFFI
conversation.  In particular that we can not really do typing that we
need to take care of.
