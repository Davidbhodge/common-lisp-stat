For a fast start: 

Make the shared library liblispstat with an ANSI C compiler (only gcc
tested at this point):

       cd lib
       make

run a common lisp (SBCL, CMUCL, CLISP) starting in the current
directory.  We also assume that a recent version of CFFI and LIFT have
been installed and are ASDF-loadable.  Probably should include a local
copy just in case.

(on Debian: can use CLC or SBCL approaches, i.e.  ~/.clc/systems  or
~/.sbcl/systems should contain softlinks to the lispstat, cffi, and
lift ASDF files (i.e. lispstat.asd, cffi.asd, and lift.asd)).

Step through ls-demo.lisp for a range of examples that will become
part of the test suite.

    

So basically ..   
  
1. change directory into the CommonLispStat working directory.
2. start your lisp
3. follow the commands in the ls-demo.lisp file, i.e.
 
   a. (load "init.lisp")
   b. (in-package :ls-user)
   c. (normal-rand 20)
   d. (setf mytest (normal-rand 20))


   and see if they work (basic CFFI functionality for external C
   library, LIFT package for unit-testing framework to ensure run time
   stability).
  
4. Tell me ( <blindglobe@gmail.com> ) if there is any thing wrong (or
   if anything happens to work.

CMUCL and SBCL work justfine at this stage.

CLISP is finicky regarding the problems that we have with CFFI
conversation.  In particular that we can not really do typing that we
need to take care of.

See Doc/INSTALL for getting this to work and run

===========



Working on this with git:



    git clone git://repo.or.cz/CommonLispStat.git 


will pull the whole repository, and create a "master" branch to work
on.  Probably, you don't want to use the master branch, but more to
use a topic-centric branch, so you might:

    git checkout -b myTopicBranch

and then work on myTopicBranch, pulling back to the master branch when
needed by



    git checkout master
    git pull . myTopicBranch


of course, perhaps you want to contribute to the mob branch.   For
that, after cloning the repository as above, you would:


    git checkout -b mob remotes/origin/mob

<work, work, work... through a cycle of

         <edit>
	 git add <files just edited>
	 git commit -m "what I just did"

 ad-nauseum.  When ready to commit, then just >

	 git push git+ssh://mob@repo.or.cz/srv/git/CommonLispStat.git mob:mob



and it'll be put on the mob branch, as a proposal for merging.

Another approach would be to pull from the topic branch into the mob
branch before uploading.   Will work on a formal example soon.


(but the basic principle is that instead of the edit cycle on mob, do
something like:

  git checkout mob
  git pull . myTopicBranch
  git push git+ssh://mob@repo.or.cz/srv/git/CommonLispStat.git mob:mob


)
