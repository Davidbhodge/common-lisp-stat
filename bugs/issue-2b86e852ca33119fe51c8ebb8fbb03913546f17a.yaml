title: Reorg of data packages needed
desc: |-
  Data structure is split up far too much.   Design should be refactored so that we
  consider how the range of functionality, from data frames (storage) to data integration
  (merging) to data manipulation (creation and transformation) are separated into activity-centric
  packages/objects.   This is needed to ensure that we can modulate what it is that we will
  put back together for appropriate functionality.
