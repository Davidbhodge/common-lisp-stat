;;; designers and quality assurance people in its wake.

;;; This organization and structure is new to the 21st Century
;;; version.

;;; conside    that dataa has 3 genotypic chracteristrics.  The first
;;; would be form -- scalar, vector, array.   second would be
;;; datarep type.  in particular integer, real, string, symbol.  The last
;;; would be statistical type.  augmenting datarep type with use in a
;;; statistical context, i.e. that would include nominal, ordinal,
;;; integer, continous, interval (orderable subtypes)

;;; Data Types:
;;;
;;; Data types are the representation of data from a computer-science
;;; perspective, i.e. what it is that they contain.  These types
;;; include particular forms of compound types (i.e. dataframe,
;;; relationdata are compounds of arrays of different types where the
;;; difference is row-wise, while array is a compound of elements of
;;; the same type.

;;Examples:
;;  (defun equidimensional (a)
;;    (or (< (array-rank a) 2)
;;        (apply #'= (array-dimensions a)))) =>  EQUIDIMENSIONAL
;;  (deftype square-matrix (&optional type size)
;;    `(and (array ,type (,size ,size))
;;          (satisfies equidimensional))) =>  SQUARE-MATRIX
