Need to record how we got this, using 

     darcs pull http://common-lisp.net/project/lift/darcs/lift/

and then ignoring the darcs repo, as well as resources and website.

Currently at version 1.3.5

Better, is that we make this into its own git submodule, and retrack
as needed from there.  But need to have a one-way sync from darcs that
can be updated, which is not the current case, AFAIK.
