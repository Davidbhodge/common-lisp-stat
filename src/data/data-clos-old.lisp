;;; What is this talk of 'release'? Klingons do not make software
;;; 'releases'.  Our software 'escapes', leaving a bloody trail of
;;; designers and quality assurance people in its wake.

;;; This organization and structure is new to the 21st Century
;;; version.

;;; data-clos.lisp
;;; 
;;; redoing data structures in a CLOS based framework.
;;;
;;; No real basis for work, there is a bit of new-ness and R-ness to
;;; this work. In particular, the notion of relation is key and
;;; integral to the analysis.  Tables are related and matched
;;; vectors,for example.  "column" vectors are related observations
;;; (by measure/recording) while "row" vectors are related readings
;;; (by case)
;;;

;;; Relational structure -- can we capture a completely unnormalized
;;; data strucutre to propose possible modeling approaches, and
;;; propose appropriate models and inferential strategies?
;;;

;; verb-driven schema for data collection.  Should encode independence
;; or lack of when possible.
