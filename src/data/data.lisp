;;; Purpose:    data package for lispstat

;;; What is this talk of 'release'? Klingons do not make software
;;; 'releases'.  Our software 'escapes', leaving a bloody trail of
;;; designers and quality assurance people in its wake.

;;; This organization and structure is new to the 21st Century
;;; version.

(in-package :lisp-stat-data)

;;; consider that data has 3 genotypic characteristics.  The first
;;; is storage form -- scalar, vector, array.  second would be datarep
;;; ("computer science simplistic data" type.  in particular integer,
;;; real, string, symbol.  The last would be statistical type
;;; ("usually handled by computer science approaches via metadata").
;;; augmenting datarep type with use in a statistical context,
;;; i.e. that would include nominal, ordinal, integer, continous,
;;; interval (orderable subtypes).  Clearly, the statistical type can
;;; be inherited, likewise the numerical type as well.  The form can
;;; be pushed up or simplified as necessary, but this can be
;;; challenging.

;;; The first approach considered is for CLS to handle this as
;;; lisp-only structures.  When we realize an "abstract" model, the
;;; data should be pushed into an appropriate form (either "en masse",
;;; or "on-demand") into a linear algebra framework.

;;; There is some excellent material on this by John Chambers in one
;;; of his earlier books.  Reference is being ignored to encourage
;;; people to read them all.  With all due respect to John, they've
;;; lasted quite well, but need to be updated.

;;; The purpose of this package is to manage data which will be
;;; processed by LispStat.  In particular, it will be important to
;;; register variables, datasets, relational structures, and other
;;; objects which could be the target for statistical modeling and
;;; inference.

;;; Data (storage) Types, dt-{.*}
;;;
;;; Data types are the representation of data from a computer-science
;;; perspective, i.e. what it is that they contain, in the sense of
;;; scalars, arrays, networks, but not the actual values or
;;; statistical behavour of the values.  These types include
;;; particular forms of compound types (i.e. dataframe is array-like,
;;; but types differ, difference is row-wise, while array is a
;;; compound of elements of the same type.
;;; 
;;; This is completely subject to change, AND HAS.  We use a class
;;; heirarchy to generate the types, deriving from the virtual
;;; dataframe-like and matrix-like classes to construct what we think
;;; we might need.


;;; Statistical Variable Types, sv-{.*} or statistical-variable-{.*}
;;; 
;;; Statistical variable types work to represent the statistical
;;; category represented by the variable, i.e. nominal, ordinal,
;;; integral, continous, ratio.   This metadata can be used to hint at
;;; appropriate analysis methods -- or perhaps more critically, to
;;; define how these methods will fail in the final interrpretation.  

;;; originally, these were considered to be types, but now, we
;;; consider this in terms of abstract classes and mix-ins.
