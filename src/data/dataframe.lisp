;;; Purpose:    Data packaging and access for Common Lisp Statistics,
;;;             using a DATAFRAME-LIKE virtual structure.
;;;             This redoes dataframe structures in adfcolumn CLOS based
;;;             framework.   Currently contains the virtual class
;;;             DATAFRAME-LIKE as well as the actual classes
;;;             DATAFRAME-ARRAY and DATAFRAME-MATRIXLIKE.

;;; What is this talk of 'release'? Klingons do not make software
;;; 'releases'.  Our software 'escapes', leaving a bloody trail of
;;; designers and quality assurance people in its wake.

;;; No real basis for work, there is a bit of new-ness and R-ness to
;;; this work. In particular, the notion of relation is key and
;;; integral to the analysis.  Tables are related and matched vectors,
;;; for example.  "column" vectors are related observations (by
;;; measure/recording) while "row" vectors are related readings (by
;;; case, independence).  This does mean that we are placing
;;; statistical semantics into the computational data object -- and
;;; that it is a violation of use to consider rows which are not at
;;; the least conditionally independent (though the conditioning
;;; should be outside the data set, not internally specified).

;;; So we want a verb-driven API for data collection construction.  We
;;; should encode independence or lack of, as a computable status.

;;; Need to figure out statistically-typed vectors.  We then map a
;;; series of typed vectors over to tables where columns are equal
;;; typed.  In a sense, this is a relation (1-1) of equal-typed
;;; arrays.  For the most part, this ends up making the R data.frame
;;; into a relational building block (considering 1-1 mappings using
;;; row ID as a relation).  Is this a worthwhile generalization or
;;; communicable analogy?

;;; verbs vs semantics for DF construction -- consider the possibily
;;; of how adverbs and verbs relate, where to put which semantically
;;; to allow for general approach.

;;; Need to consider modification APIs
;;; actions are:
;;; - import 
;;; - get/set row names (case names)
;;; -         column names (variable names)
;;; -         dataset values
;;; -         annotation/metadata
;;; -    make sure that we do coherency checking in the exported
;;; -    functions.
;;; -    ... 
;;; - reshapeData/reformat/reshapr a reformed version of the dataset (no
;;;           additional input). 
;;; -         either overwriting or not, i.e. with or without copy.
;;; - check consistency of resulting data with metadata and related
;;;           data information.

;;; Is there any need for an N-way dataframe (N>2) ?   Am currently
;;; assuming not, that this is specializing only the
;;; "independent cases"-by-variables format and that there would be
;;; other tools for other structures.

;;; Misc Functions (to move into a lisp data manipulation support package)

;; the next two should be merged into a general replicator or iterator
;; pattern.

     basically a rectangular table without storage.  We emulate that,
     and add storage, row/column labels, and within-column-typing.

     DATAFRAME-LIKE is the basic cases by variables framework.  Need
     to embed this within other structures which allow for generalized
     relations.  Goal is to ensure that relations imply and drive the
     potential for statistical relativeness such as correlation,
     interference, and similar concepts.

     STORE is the storage component.  We ignore this in the
     DATAFRAME-LIKE class, as it is the primary differentiator,
     spec'ing the structure used for storing the actual data.  We
     create methods which depend on STORE for access.  The onlyr
     critical component is that STORE be a class which is
     xarray-compliant.  Examples of such mixins are DATAFRAME-ARRAY
     and DATAFRAME-MATRIXLIKE.  The rest of this structure is
     metadata."))
