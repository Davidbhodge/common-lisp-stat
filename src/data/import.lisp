;;; Data I/O

;; We can read 2 types of data -- those which are non-lisp-native
;; data, and those which are lisp-native (lisp-enabled, an extension
;; of lisp-serialized, i.e. data as program as data thingy's).

;; of the non-native, there could be raw sources (ascii file formats),
;; xml sources (xml -> lisp, possible with some preprocessing.

;;; Reading from DSV files:

;;; consider either the cybertyggyr-dsv package, or the rsm.string
;;; package.  The latter seems to actually work a bit at what we need
;;; to acccomplish, but the former is a challenge to get right when we
;;; need to think abut what it is that we need to get done.  The
;;; latter is also better licensed. i.e. BSD-style.
