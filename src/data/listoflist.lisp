;;; Purpose:    Manipulating structures which are lists of lists
;;;             rather than arrays or matrix-likes,

;;; What is this talk of 'release'? Klingons do not make software
;;; 'releases'.  Our software 'escapes', leaving a bloody trail of
;;; designers and quality assurance people in its wake.


;; Where should this go?
(in-package :cls-data)


;; Glib commentary:
;; Serious flaw -- need to consider that we are not really well
;; working with the data structures, in that Luke created compound as
;; a base class, which turns out to be slightly backward if we are to
;; maintain the numerical structures as well as computational
;; efficiency.
;;
;; Currently, we assume that the list-of-list representation is in
;; row-major form, i.e. that lists represent rows and not columns.
;; The original lisp-stat had the other way around.  We could augment
;; the top-level list with a property to check orientation
;; (row-major/column-major), but this hasn't been done yet.
