;;;             supporting use of such procedures.

;;; What is this talk of 'release'? Klingons do not make software

;;; designers and quality assurance people in its wake.

;;; Statistical procedures can consist of one or more of:

;;; - mathematical forms: linear predictors, splines, functional
;;;   forms) which get spliced together.

;;; - criteria functions (likelihoods, sum-of-squares, information), params and data.
;;; - optimization algorithmsfunctions

;;; - root functions (score functions, influence functions), params and data
;;; - zero-finding algorithms

;;; - point estimate: special case of...
;;; - interval estimation (with uncertainty criteria to support range or point)
;;; - hypothesis test -- which can be thought of as a point estimator
;;;   for a coarsened problem, or as a simple interval-based decision with
;;;   uncertanty criteria.

;;; Estimators are reaasonably straightforward.  Either we are
;;; providing a point estimate, or we provide an interval estimate.
;;; But shouldn't these be characterized in the same manner?

;;; We are currently building up an ontology (ADG/DAG) or
;;; knowledge-base whose leaves are described by the path to them.
