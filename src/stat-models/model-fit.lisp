;;; What is this talk of 'release'? Klingons do not make software
;;; 'releases'.  Our software 'escapes', leaving a bloody trail of
;;; designers and quality assurance people in its wake.

;;; The model class is used to map a partial or complete model
;;; specification (partial specification made complete by assumptions
;;; inherent in the type of model used, i.e. linear regression assumes
;;; mean-zero and homoskedasticity) and the model-fit class is used to
;;; complete the model specification into how the model instance and
;;; type will then get computed.  The approach tken is that we
;;; definitiely want to be able to see how we can explicitly try to
;;; characterize the work that we are trying to infere about the data.
