;;; The model class is used to map a partial or complete model
;;; specification (partial specification made complete by assumptions
;;; inherent in the type of model used, i.e. linear regression assumes
;;; mean-zero and homoskedasticity) and the model-fit class is used to
;;; complete the model specification into how the model instance and

;;;;; More mischief from a different time


;; regression-model is the old API, but regression as a generic will
;; be the new API.  We need to distinguish between APIs which enable
;; the user to do clear activities, and APIs which enable developers
;; to do clear extensions and development, and underlying
;; infrastructure to keep everything straight and enabled.

;; There are conflicting theories for how to structure the
;; specification of mathematical models, along with the statistical
;; inference, along with the data which is instantiating the model.
;; 
;; i.e.:  mathematical model for the relationships between components,
;; between a component and a summarizing parameter, and between
;; parameters.
;; 
;; statistical inference describes the general approach for
;; aggregating into a decision and has impliciations for the scale up
;; from the model on a single instance to the generalization.
;;
;; The data represents the particular substantive context that is
;; driving the model/inference combination, and about which we hope to
;; generate knowledge.
;; 
;; numerical analysis selects appropriate algorithms/implementations
;; for combining the above 3.  
;; 
;; the end result is input on the decision being made (which could be
;; specific (decision analysis/testing), risk-analysis (interval
;; estimation) , most likely/appropriate selection (point estimation)
